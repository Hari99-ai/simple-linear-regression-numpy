# Simple Linear Regression from Scratch

This project demonstrates how to implement **Simple Linear Regression** from scratch in Python using **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.

## üìä Overview

Simple Linear Regression models the relationship between two variables by fitting a straight line to the data. The goal is to find the best-fit line described by:

y = b‚ÇÄ + b‚ÇÅx

Where:
- `b‚ÇÄ` is the intercept
- `b‚ÇÅ` is the slope

This script:
- Computes the coefficients manually
- Prints them
- Visualizes the data and fitted line
